"Vectors have both magnitude and direction. They follow commutative and associative properties of addition, and distributive property of scalar multiplication. We can add vectors by adding their corresponding components, and scalar multiplication changes the magnitude but not the direction. These operations are essential for vector algebra and applications in physics and engineering."
